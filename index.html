    	<h3>my family</h3>
    	<p>My family is simple but great to say the least. My father is a <br> government employee, he is a consultant at Pasig Action Line. <br>  My mother, a hardworking housewife that does her best to be a <br>great mother. Me and my mother's idea of bonding is her  teaching <br> me how to cook dishes we eat at the dinner table. My me and my <br>father's bonding however is a bit awkward to say but basically we <br>just get drunk and have fun most of the time, it's kinda bad to teach <br> your child vices but he raised me good and well to be aware and <br>self-concious. </p>

    	<p> I have 3 siblings and 4 step-siblings. Including me, <br>we are in total of 8 children, 2 of them already have their own <br>family.</p>

    <div class="myhobbies" id="hobbies">
    	<h4>my hobbies</h4>
    	<p>I love to kill time by playing guitar and singing, learning new songs <br>and just keep playing until my fingers or my throat hurts, i take <br> hours and hours just by playing guitar and singing. I do have a <br>passion for music but my father won't let me pursue that career, so <br> i let it just be a hobby, for now i guess.</p>

    <div class="skillstalents" id="s/t">
    	<h5>skills / talents</h5>
    	<p>I would say that I have good problem-solving, communication, and <br>conflict resolution skills. As a 19 year-old person, I know I could <br>and will learn more skills and hone the ones I already have. <br><br>

    	As for talents, I only developed decent singing and learned <br>playing an acoustic guitar. I depend on my experiences on learning <br>new skills and talents and I'm willing to learn if given the chance.</p>

    <div class="strengthsweakness" id="sw">
        <h6>strengths  and  weaknesses</h6>
        <p>I consider my communication skills to be one of my greatest <br> strengths. Some people that dreams to be in the IT field assume <br>they don’t need strong communication skills to work in the tech <br>as communication skills are frequently underrated in terms of IT.<br> However, as what i have learned from my uncle that's a <br> programmer, such assumptions are false as most IT people are <br>supposed to communicate effectively and clearly with the<br> managers, clients, coworkers and even customers. In short, <br>technical skills are incomplete without soft skills like communication <br>skills. I am looking forward to hone and enhance this certain skill<br> in me.<br><br>

        As for my weaknesses, I find public speaking intimidating and have <br>often struggled with presentations. Shyness is also something that <br>I struggle in with groups. I find it intimidating to ask questions or <br>raise points, so I have often remained quiet in the past. Lastly, <br>self-criticism has brought me down a couple of times, i tend <br>to evaluate myself negatively most of the time. I am trying to be <br>more self-concious and aware of these weaknesses to try and <br>counter the negative effects of these such things. </p>

    <div class="dreamjob" id="dj">
    <h6>Dream job</h6>
    <p>My dream career? I haven't really put much thought on what I want to be, I'm young <br>and only at my first year of college. Whatever I put in my mind now surely will change in <br>the next couple of years. As what Paulo Coelho, a brazilian lyricist said “Whatever <br>you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy.” And Confucius, a chinese <br> philosopher said “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your <br>life.” So I'm just being careful on the steps i take on my journey.</p>
